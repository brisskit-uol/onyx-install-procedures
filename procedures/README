QUICK START.
============

1. Unzip this package into the standard BRISSKit install directory 
   (ie: to /var/local/brisskit/onyx)
2. Edit the set.sh file within the brisskit bin/global directory of the install package.
   'Source' the set.sh file at the start of any shell session.
   (There should be no need to do this as sudo or root)
   Use "source ./set.sh" or ". ./set.sh" at the command line or within a composition script.
   Remember, if you execute any script as sudo, then you must inherit the environment variables; eg:
   > sudo -E ./0-prerequisites.sh job-20130214
   (The 7-install-onyx-procedures.sh is one that must be executed as sudo as it installs a cron job)
3  Review configuration settings within the config directory.
   DO NOT forget the cron-params which must contain a correct absolute path.
4. The order of completion is by number within the procedures/bin/installs directory
   Alternatively, use the composed script ONYX_INSTALL_PROCS_HOME/compositions/install-all.sh
