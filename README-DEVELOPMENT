Inspect the POM.
================

There is a production profile and a development profile.
The build is production by default.
Look at the enironment.type property setting, 
which is used to produce two artifacts (development and production versions)... 

To build a production artifact, the default install invocation is sufficient...
mvn clean install

To build a development artifact...
mvn clean install -Denvironment.type=development

To deploy to the remote BRISSKit repos, replace "install" with "deploy" in the above.
